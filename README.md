# TL;DR — Komorebi.exe: the Chad WM for Windows 10+

## What it is:
Komorebi is a dynamic tiling window manager for Windows 10/11 that piggybacks off Microsoft's Desktop Window Manager (DWM). Think i3wm or bspwm but for Windows — without gutting your entire GUI experience.

## Why it's cool:
- **Tiling windows** = less alt-tabbing, more doing.
- **CLI-powered** for automation gods.
- **Plays nice** with AutoHotKey and whkd for custom hotkeys.
- **Zero invasive OS tweaks**. It’s like a guest that brings their own snacks and doesn’t trash your place.

## Licensing & Usage
- **Personal use**: Free, educational, but no redistribution/hard-forking.
- **Commercial use**: Requires a paid license (respect the hustle).
- **Moral clause**: Consider donating to Gaza relief before supporting dev. Mad respect for that.

## Integration Potential (for mad dev scientists 🧪)
- Real-time event hooks via named pipes? **Check.**
- Exportable state as JSON? **Check.**
- Modding-friendly? **Triple check.** Fork away for personal tweaks or PR-worthy enhancements.
- Easter egg releases on physical media? **Yep.** That’s peak hipster-dev energy.

## Why Not FancyZones?
Let’s be honest — FancyZones is great if your idea of "customization" is dragging boxes with a mouse and calling it productivity. Komorebi is for devs who talk in keybinds and breathe JSON configs.

## Final Verdict
- **Rating**: 10/10 Would Ctrl+Win+H again.

Komorebi is like an anime protagonist’s training arc. It starts quiet and unassuming, then hits you with high-octane efficiency and a sleek layout that makes you feel like you’re hacking the Matrix — even if you’re just moving Notepad.
