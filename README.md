## Why it's cool:
- **Tiling windows** = less alt-tabbing, more doing.
- **CLI-powered** for automation gods.
- **Plays nice** with AutoHotKey and whkd for custom hotkeys.
- **Zero invasive OS tweaks**. It‚Äôs like a guest that brings their own snacks and doesn‚Äôt trash your place.

# Window Manager Event Subscriptions

## Named Pipes

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Named Pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes).

First, your application must create a named pipe. Once the named pipe has been created, run the following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-pipe <your pipe name>
```

Note that you do not have to include the full path of the named pipe, just the name.

If the named pipe exists, `komorebi` will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages:

```json lines
{"event":{"type":"AddSubscriber","content":"yasb"},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusWindow","content":"Left"},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusChange","content":["SystemForeground",{"hwnd":131444,"title":"komorebi ‚Äì README.md","exe":"idea64.exe","class":"SunAwtFrame","rect":{"left":13,"top":60,"right":1520,"bottom":1655}}]},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"MonitorPoll","content":["ObjectCreate",{"hwnd":5572450,"title":"OLEChannelWnd","exe":"explorer.exe","class":"OleMainThreadWndClass","rect":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":0,"bottom":0}}]},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusWindow","content":"Right"},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusChange","content":["SystemForeground",{"hwnd":132968,"title":"Windows PowerShell","exe":"WindowsTerminal.exe","class":"CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS","rect":{"left":1539,"top":60,"right":1520,"bottom":821}}]},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusWindow","content":"Down"},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusChange","content":["SystemForeground",{"hwnd":329264,"title":"den ‚Äî Mozilla Firefox","exe":"firefox.exe","class":"MozillaWindowClass","rect":{"left":1539,"top":894,"right":1520,"bottom":821}}]},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusWindow","content":"Up"},"state":{}}
{"event":{"type":"FocusChange","content":["SystemForeground",{"hwnd":132968,"title":"Windows PowerShell","exe":"WindowsTerminal.exe","class":"CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS","rect":{"left":1539,"top":60,"right":1520,"bottom":821}}]},"state":{}}
```

You may then filter on the `type` key to listen to the events that you are interested in. For a full list of possible
notification types, refer to the enum variants of `WindowManagerEvent` in `komorebi` and `SocketMessage`
in `komorebi::core`.

Below is an example of how you can subscribe to and filter on events using a named pipe in `nodejs`.

```javascript
const { exec } = require("child_process");
const net = require("net");

const pipeName = "\\\\.\\pipe\\komorebi-js";
const server = net.createServer((stream) => {
  console.log("Client connected");

  // Every time there is a workspace-related event, let's log the names of all
  // workspaces on the currently focused monitor, and then log the name of the
  // currently focused workspace on that monitor

  stream.on("data", (data) => {
    let json = JSON.parse(data.toString());
    let event = json.event;

    if (event.type.includes("Workspace")) {
      let monitors = json.state.monitors;
      let current_monitor = monitors.elements[monitors.focused];
      let workspaces = monitors.elements[monitors.focused].workspaces;
      let current_workspace = workspaces.elements[workspaces.focused];

      console.log(
        workspaces.elements
          .map((workspace) => workspace.name)
          .filter((name) => name !== null)
      );
      console.log(current_workspace.name);
    }
  });

  stream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Client disconnected");
  });
});

server.listen(pipeName, () => {
  console.log("Named pipe server listening");
});

const command = "komorebic subscribe-pipe komorebi-js";

exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
});
```

## Unix Domain Sockets

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Unix Domain Sockets](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/).

UDS are also the only mode of communication between `komorebi` and `komorebic`.

First, your application must create a socket in `$ENV:LocalAppData\komorebi`. Once the socket has been created, run the
following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-socket <your socket name>
```

If the socket exists, komorebi will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages as in the
example above in the Named Pipes section.

## Rust Client

As of `v0.1.22` it is possible to use the `komorebi-client` crate to subscribe to notifications of
every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled by `komorebi` in a Rust codebase.

Below is a simple example of how to use `komorebi-client` in a basic Rust application.

```rust
// komorebi-client = { git = "https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi", tag = "v0.1.35"}

use anyhow::Result;
use komorebi_client::Notification;
use komorebi_client::NotificationEvent;
use komorebi_client::UnixListener;
use komorebi_client::WindowManagerEvent;
use std::io::BufRead;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::io::Read;

pub fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
  let socket = komorebi_client::subscribe(NAME)?;

  for incoming in socket.incoming() {
    match incoming {
      Ok(data) => {
        let reader = BufReader::new(data.try_clone()?);

        for line in reader.lines().flatten() {
          let notification: Notification = match serde_json::from_str(&line) {
            Ok(notification) => notification,
            Err(error) => {
              log::debug!("discarding malformed komorebi notification: {error}");
              continue;
            }
          };

          // match and filter on desired notifications
        }
      }
      Err(error) => {
        log::debug!("{error}");
      }
    }
  }

}
```

## Licensing & Usage
- **Personal use**: Free, educational, but no redistribution/hard-forking.
- **Commercial use**: Requires a paid license (respect the hustle).
- **Moral clause**: Consider donating to Gaza relief before supporting dev. Mad respect for that.

## Integration Potential (for mad dev scientists üß™)
- Real-time event hooks via named pipes? **Check.**
- Exportable state as JSON? **Check.**
- Modding-friendly? **Triple check.** Fork away for personal tweaks or PR-worthy enhancements.
- Easter egg releases on physical media? **Yep.** That‚Äôs peak hipster-dev energy.

## Why Not FancyZones?
Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî FancyZones is great if your idea of "customization" is dragging boxes with a mouse and calling it productivity. Komorebi is for devs who talk in keybinds and breathe JSON configs.

## Final Verdict
- **Rating**: 10/10 Would Ctrl+Win+H again.

Komorebi is like an anime protagonist‚Äôs training arc. It starts quiet and unassuming, then hits you with high-octane efficiency and a sleek layout that makes you feel like you‚Äôre hacking the Matrix ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre just moving Notepad.
