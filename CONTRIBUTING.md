# Contributing to the Project

The project is a collection of contributions from both the project leaders and
community members. There are many ways to contribute, this can include content
in the project repositories, as well as contributing in public and private
conversation, assisting users, writing blog posts, and many other ways.

## How contributions are made

Contributions to the project primarily happen in the project source
repositories, but may also occur in other places, such as discussion forums and
public and private discourse.

## Contributing content to the Project

In order for the project leaders to manage sustained progress toward the
project goals and maintain project velocity, focus and quality, the project may
adjust the license terms over time.

Content contributed to the project must therefore be provided under
sufficiently liberal terms to allow these operations to proceed unimpeded. As
such contributions are accepted with the following understanding:

* Contributed content is licensed under the terms of the 0-BSD license
* Contributors accept the terms of the project license at the time of
  contribution

By making a contribution, you accept both the current project license terms,
and that all contributions that you have made are provided under the terms of
the 0-BSD license.
